# Unique Binary Search Trees Requirements
## Introduction
The system should calculate the number of structurally unique binary search trees (BST's) that can be formed with n nodes, where each node has a unique value from 1 to n.

## Functional Requirements
1. The system should take an integer n as input, where 1 <= n <= 19.
2. The system should return the number of unique BST's that can be formed with n nodes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should be efficient and scalable.
2. The system should handle invalid inputs and provide meaningful error messages.

## Example Use Cases
1. Input: n = 3, Output: 5
2. Input: n = 1, Output: 1

## Constraints
1. The input n should be an integer between 1 and 19 (inclusive).
2. The system should only consider BST's with unique node values from 1 to n.
